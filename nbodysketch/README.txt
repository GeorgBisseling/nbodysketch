This is inspired by the fine material about simulating dense stellar
clusters as presented here: 

http://www.artcompsci.org/kali/

As of this writing only an Euler forward integrator and a leapfrog
integrator are implemented.

Plan is to suggest this project as a tutorial series for interested
programmer-wanna-bees.

Visual Studio Express 2012 and C# were chosen to support a wide
audience without having to introduce everybody to linux.

Some candy like graphical output shall definitely be added.

Later on it may be explored if the performance critical parts could
be: parallelized, implemented in C++, OpenCL or CUDA and what not.
